## Problem 4

Consider the class **Problem4**. Create a **jUnit** test class which contains a method called **`testSortRandom()`**, which tests the method **`sort`** as follows:

 1. Generate an array of some random length between 0 ... 100 (inclusive), each element in the array being a randomly-generated integer between -1,000,000 â€¦ 1,000,000 (inclusive).
 2. Check that the output returned by calling **`sort`** with the generated array as input is **sorted** and has the **same length** as the input.
 3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 for 100 times.
